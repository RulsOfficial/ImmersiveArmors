Hosted on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-armors)

Check out the config documentation [here](https://github.com/Luke100000/ImmersiveArmors/blob/HEAD/config.md).

This fork was made for a server im making (Nonprofit), in this fork i have nerfed most of the armor, modified and changed their crafting so that the mod is more balanced with the vanilla game.
